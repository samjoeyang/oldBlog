<p>1. So, tell me a little about yourself.<br />
You don't need to explain everything from birth to present day.<br />
Relevant facts about education, your career and your current life<br />
situation are fine.</p>
<p>2. Why are you looking (or why did you leave you last job)?<br />
This should be a straightforward question to answer, but it can trip<br />
you up. Presumably you are looking for a new job (or any job) because<br />
you want to advance your career and get a position that allows you to<br />
grow as a person and an employee. It's not a good idea to mention<br />
money here, it can make you sound mercenary. And if you are in the<br />
unfortunate situation of having been downsized, stay positive and be<br />
a***rief as pos***le about it. If you were fired, you'll need a good<br />
explanation. But once again, stay positive.</p>
<p>3. Tell me what you know about this company.<br />
Do your homework before you go to any interview. Whether it'***eing<br />
the VP of marketing or the mailroom clerk, you should know about the<br />
company or business you're going to work for. Has this company been in<br />
the news lately? Who are the people in the company you should know<br />
about? Do the background work, it will make you stand out as someone<br />
who comes prepared, and is genuinely interested in the company and the<br />
job.</p>
<p>4. Why do you want to work at X Company?<br />
This should be directly related to the last question. Any research<br />
you've done on the company should have led you to the conclusion that<br />
you'd want to work there. After all, you're at the interview, right?<br />
Put some thought into this answer before you have your interview,<br />
mention your career goals and highlight forward-thinking goals and<br />
career plans.</p>
<p>5. What relevant experience do you have?<br />
Hopefully if you're applying for this position you have bags of<br />
related experience, and if that's the case you should mention it all.<br />
But if you're switching careers or trying something a little<br />
different, your experience may initially not look like it's matching<br />
up. That's when you need a little honest creativity to match the<br />
experiences required with the ones you have. People skills are people<br />
skills after all, you just need to show how customer service skills<br />
can apply to internal management positions, and so on.</p>
<p>6. If your previous co-workers were here, what would they say about you?<br />
Ok, this is not the time for full disclosure. If some people from your<br />
past are going to say you're a boring A-hole, you don't need to bring<br />
that up. Stay positive, always, and maybe have a few specific quotes<br />
in mind. "They'd say I was a hard worker" or even better "John Doe has<br />
always said I was the most reliable, creative problem-solver he'd ever<br />
met."</p>
<p>7. Have you done anything to further your experience?<br />
This could include anything from night classes to hobbies and sports.<br />
If it's related, it's worth mentioning. Obviously anything to do with<br />
further education is great, but maybe you're spending time on a home<br />
improvement project to work on skills such as self-sufficiency, time<br />
management and motivation.</p>
<p>8. Where else have you applied?<br />
This is a good way to hint that you're in demand, without sounding<br />
like you're whoring yourself all over town. So, be honest and mention<br />
a few other companie***ut don't go into detail. The fact that you're<br />
seriously looking and keeping your options open is what the<br />
interviewer is driving at.</p>
<p>9. How are you when you're working under pressure?<br />
Once again, there are a few ways to answer thi***ut they should all be<br />
positive. You may work well under pressure, you may thrive under<br />
pressure, and you may actually PREFER working under pressure. If you<br />
say you crumble like aged blue cheese, this is not going to help you<br />
get your foot in the door.</p>
<p>10. What motivates you to do a good job?<br />
The answer to this one is not money, even if it is. You should be<br />
motivated by life's noble pursuits. You want recognition for a job<br />
well done. You want to become better at your job. You want to help<br />
others or be a leader in your field.</p>
<p>11. What's your greatest strength?<br />
This is your chance to shine. You're being asked to explain why you<br />
are a great employee, so don't hold back and stay do stay positive.<br />
You could be someone who thrives under pressure, a great motivator, an<br />
amazing problem solver or someone with extraordinary attention to<br />
detail. If your greatest strength, however, is to drink anyone under<br />
the table or get a top score on Mario Kart, keep it to yourself. The<br />
interviewer is looking for work-related strengths.</p>
<p>12. What's your biggest weakness?<br />
If you're completely honest, you may be kicking yourself in the butt.<br />
If you say you don't have one, you're obviously lying. This is a<br />
horrible question and one that politicians have become masters at<br />
answering. They say things like "I'm perhaps too committed to my work<br />
and don't spend enough time with my family." Oh, there's a fireable<br />
offense. I've even heard "I think I'm too good at my job, it can often<br />
make people jealous." Please, let's keep our feet on the ground. If<br />
you're asked this question, give a small, work-related flaw that<br />
you're working hard to improve. Example: "I've been told I<br />
occasionally focus on details and miss the bigger picture, so I've<br />
been spending time laying out the complete project every day to see my<br />
overall progress."</p>
<p>13. Let's talk about salary. What are you looking for?<br />
Run for cover! This is one tricky game to play in an interview. Even<br />
if you know the salary range for the job, if you answer first you're<br />
already showing all your cards. You want as much as pos***le, the<br />
employer wants you for as little as you're willing to take. Before you<br />
apply, take a look at <a href="http://salary.com">salary.com</a> for a good idea of what someone with<br />
your specific experience should be paid. You may want to say, "well,<br />
that's something I've thought long and hard about and I think someone<br />
with my experience should get between X &amp; Y." Or, you could be sly and<br />
say, "right now, I'm more interested in talking more about what the<br />
position can offer my career." That could at least buy you a little<br />
time to scope out the situation. But if you do have a specific figure<br />
in mind and you are confident that you can get it, I'd say go for it.<br />
I have on many occasions, and every time I got very close to that<br />
figure (both below and sometimes above).</p>
<p>14. Are you good at working in a team?<br />
Unless you have the I.Q. of a houseplant, you'll always answer YES to<br />
this one. It's the only answer. How can anyone function inside an<br />
organization if they are a loner? You may want to mention what part<br />
you like to play in a team though; it's a great chance to explain that<br />
you're a natural leader.</p>
<p>15. Tell me a suggestion you have made that was implemented.<br />
It's important here to focus on the word "implemented." There's<br />
nothing wrong with having a thousand great ideas, but if the only<br />
place they live is on your notepad what's the point? Better still, you<br />
need a good ending. If your previous company took your advice and<br />
ended up going bankrupt, that's not such a great example either. Be<br />
prepared with a story about an idea of yours that was taken from idea<br />
to implementation, and considered successful.</p>
<p>16. Has anything ever irritated you about people you've worked with?<br />
Of course, you have a list as long as your arm. But you can't say<br />
that, it shows you a***eing negative and difficult to work with. The<br />
best way to answer this one is to think for a while and then say<br />
something like "I've always got on just fine with my co-workers<br />
actually."</p>
<p>Use this question as a chance to show that you are a team player: "The<br />
only people I have trouble with are those who aren't team players, who<br />
just don't perform, who complain constantly, and who fail to respond<br />
to any efforts to motivate them." The interviewer is expecting a<br />
response focused on personality and personal dislikes. Surprise her by<br />
delivering an answer that reflects company values</p>
<p>17. Is there anyone you just could not work with?<br />
No. Well, unless you're talking about murderers, racists, rapists,<br />
thieves or other dastardly characters, you can work with anyone.<br />
Otherwise you could be flagged as someone who's picky and difficult if<br />
you say, "I can't work with anyone who's a Bronco's fan. Sorry."</p>
<p>18. Tell me about any issues you've had with a previou***oss.<br />
Arrgh! If you fall for this one you shouldn't be hired anyway. The<br />
interviewer is testing you to see if you'll speak badly about your<br />
previous supervisor. Simply answer this question with exteme tact,<br />
diplomacy and if necessary, a big fat loss of memory. In short, you've<br />
never had any issues.</p>
<p>The answer to 18 is completely wrong. I am a director at a major media<br />
company's interactive division. Our company is expanding and I am<br />
almost in a constant state of hiring. I ask a variation of this<br />
question in every single interview and if a candidate has never had<br />
one issue or disagreement with anyone, (I stated a variation: I ask if<br />
it has happened with anyone in the workplace) I peg them as a liar and<br />
reject them immediately.</p>
<p>I went well with my previou***oss. If there is an conflict, I will be<br />
open mind and talk about facts. once decision is made, I execute it<br />
well.</p>
<p>19. Would you rather work for money or job satisfaction?<br />
It's not a very fair question is it? We'd all love to get paid a<br />
Trump-like salary doing a job we love but that's rare indeed. It's<br />
fine to say money is important, but remember that NOTHING is more<br />
important to you than the job. Otherwise, you're just someone looking<br />
for a bigger paycheck.</p>
<p>20. Would you rather be liked or feared?<br />
I have been asked this a lot, in various incarnations. The first time<br />
I just drew a blank and said, "I don't know." That went over badly,<br />
but it was right at the start of my career when I had little to no<br />
experience. Since then I've realized that my genuine answer is<br />
"Neither, I'd rather be respected." You don't want to be feared<br />
because fear is no way to motivate a team. You may got the job done<br />
but at what cost? Similarly, if you're everyone'***est friend you'll<br />
find it difficult to make tough decisions or hit deadlines. But when<br />
you're respected, you don't have to be a complete bastard or a lame<br />
duck to get the job done.</p>
<p>21. Are you willing to put the interests of X Company ahead of your own?<br />
Again, another nasty question. If you say yes, you're a corporate<br />
whore who doesn't care about family. If you say no, you're disloyal to<br />
the company. I'm afraid that you'll probably have to say yes to this<br />
one though, because you're trying to be the perfect employee at this<br />
point, and perfect employees don't cut out early for Jimmy'***a***all<br />
game.</p>
<p>it is situational. if you&hellip; ; if you &hellip;. Ethics and professionalism</p>
<p>22. So, explain why I should hire you.<br />
As I'm sure you know, "because I'm great" or "I really need a job" are<br />
not good answers here. This is a time to give the employer a laundry<br />
list of your greatest talents that just so happen to match the job<br />
description. It's also good to avoid taking potshots at other<br />
potential candidates here. Focus on yourself and your talents, not<br />
other people's flaws.</p>
<p>23. Finally, do you have any questions to ask me?<br />
I'll finish the way I started, with one of the most common questions<br />
asked in interviews. This directly relates to the research you've done<br />
on the company and also gives you a chance to show how eager and<br />
prepared you are. You'll probably want to ask about benefits if they<br />
haven't been covered already. A good generic one is "how soon could I<br />
start, if I were offered the job of course." You may also ask what<br />
you'd be working on. Specifically, in the role you're applying for and<br />
how that affects the rest of the company. Always have questions ready,<br />
greeting this one with a blank stare is a rotten way to finish your<br />
interview. Good luck and happy job hunting.</p>
<p>ponder for a moment, and then ask your interviewer "what aspect of<br />
your job do you find most challenging".</p>
<p>I would ask the interviewer, "Why do you like to work here?"</p>
<p>24. Where do you want to be in 5 to years?</p>
<p>They dont want to hear in the same job you are interviewing for.<br />
Ultimately, the HR people are searching for someone who can handle the<br />
job now, and has the potential to grow into a high level management<br />
job in the future. Do you have those goals too?</p>
<p>24. Would you rather work for a big company or a small one?</p>
<p>Favorite answer: I'd treat any company like it was my own regardless.<br />
Total ownership of the situation can get you a long way.</p>
<p>General , the worst answer was "I don't know." I've since learned that<br />
"it depends," with a couple of examples, is perfectly appropriate.</p>
